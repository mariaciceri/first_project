            <h2>Understanding the Different Types of Sport Climbing</h2>
            <p>
                Sport climbing is a dynamic and accessible form of rock climbing where climbers ascend routes equipped
                with permanent bolts and anchors. Unlike traditional climbing, which requires placing protection, sport
                climbing allows
                climbers to focus on technique and movement.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are three main kinds of sport climbing: <a href="#single-pitch-link"
                    aria-label="go to single-pitch topic"><em>single-pitch</em></a> and
                <a href="#multi-pitch-link" aria-label="go to multi-pitch topic"><em>multi-pitch</em></a> and <a
                    href="#boulder" aria-label="go to boulder topic"><em>boulder</em></a> and they
                vary
                quite
                much. So read through it and find out which one (if not all) is for you.

                            Single-pitch routes are the most common in sport climbing and are often found at climbing
                            gyms
                            and outdoor crags. These
                            routes are usually under 30 meters and can be completed in one go. Climbers clip quickdraws
                            into
                            pre-placed bolts as
                            they ascend, leading to a set of anchors at the top. Single-pitch climbs are ideal for
                            climbers
                            of all levels, from
                            beginners to intermediates.

                            Multi-pitch routes are a more advanced form of sport climbing, consisting of multiple
                            climbing
                            segments (pitches), each
                            ending at a belay station. Climbers alternate between leading and following, using these
                            stations to rest or swap roles.
                            Multi-pitch routes often lead to greater heights and offer climbers more of an adventure
                            than
                            single-pitch routes.

                            Climb with no rope and usually much lower (up to 4m high) walls/rocks. Some sport routes
                            feature short, powerful sequences known as cruxes. These sections require climbers to make
                            difficult,
                            bouldering-style moves in quick succession. Bouldery sport climbs are great for those who
                            enjoy mixing endurance with bursts of strength and problem-solving.
