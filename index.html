            <h2>Climbing History</h2>
            <p>Climbing as a sport started in the beginning of the 19th century with single-pitch climbing.
                Bouldering and multi-pitch climbing came a little bit later, around 1930. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In the 2020 Tokya Olympic Games, sport-climbing had its debut with 3 different categories: boulder, lead and speed climbing.
                Athletes had to complete in all three categories, which changed in the 2024 Paris Olympics Games, when speed climb
                got separeted from the othe two modalities. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many diffenret grades for the climbing routes, but the most common ones in Europe are
                French font-grade and American V system.

                    We are a group of 11 people passionate about climbing and alpinism. Each one
                    of us started this journey in a different way but we met all because of this
                    amazing and exciting sport.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided to provide help for others that are starting this new and brilliant
                    sport or someone that wants to step up their climbing game. So we created <em>Climbing Rox</em> 
                    to provide advice on different topics, share our own adventures to inspire others and
                    answer any specific questions you may have (write to us on <em>Get Help</em>).
